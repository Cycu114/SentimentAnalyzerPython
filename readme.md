Script should be run with python 3.5 or higer.<br>
If script is run on linux or you have installed wget and tar on windows you can uncoment two lines in script one for downloading data set and second one for unziping the file<br>
If not follow this link to download the data set http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz then extract it and put it in the same direction as script<br>
At first run script on my pc took something about 30 min after first run you can use saved models, pre processors, vectorized data.<br>
